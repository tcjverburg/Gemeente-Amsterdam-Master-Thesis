# Master-Thesis
The different drafts of the thesis, as well as feedback and the initial thesis design can be found under the folder *drafts and feedback*. All the code can be found in the folder *research*. *Research* is split up into 3 more folders, *exploratory analysis*, *pre-processing* and *modelling*. The *exploratory analysis*  was during the thesis design and only shows some insights into the raw data. *Pre-processing* contains code and non-privacy sensitive data to process and extract the text. *Modelling* contains all the code relating the the research questions and grid searches, as well as the plots of the results. Important to note is that none of the data used for the research can be found in this repository. Furthermore all output is removed due to possible privacy issues.


To install all the requirements, perform pip install requirements in the directory. This should then install all requirements for the code in this repo. Currently the beginning of each pythonfile, there are a set of parameters one has to set for the paths for different files.
