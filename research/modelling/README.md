## Modelling

This folder contains all the code relating to the different research questions and testing. All the functions are written in *model_functions.py*. The code for the grid searches is stated in *Grid searches.ipynb* and the code for the individual research questions is split over different notebooks. Furthermore, the baseline calculations are shown in *Baseline.ipynb*, the error analysis plots in *Error analysis plots.ipynb* and the code for other plots from my thesis can be found in *Plots.ipynb*.
